# Touchless-Computing-Project-Using-Python. 🚀🚀🚀

*Use python 3.12.8*

This repository is made by Sahil Gupta and i provided my 4th semester B.Tech project as an open-source project, so that any student in the future can use this repository to make this Touchless Computing Project using python.

In this repository there are 7 executable python files but if anyone wants to run: 

1.) Hand gestured virtual keyboard, then he/she should run the virtualkeboard.py. 

2.) Hand gestured virtual mouse, then he/she should run the mouse.py.

3.) Eye gestured virtual mouse, then he/she should run the eye_controlled_mouse.py.

4.) volume controller, then he/she should run the Gesture_Volume_Control.py.

5.) Voice assistant, then he/she should run the advanced_voice_assistant.py.

6.) Access all the files through the GUI by running touchless_gui.py.

7.) HandTrackingModule.py is essential for different python files to execute their hand tarcking through openCV.

⚠️⚠️ NOTE: The "HandTrackingModule.py" is essential for running the "Gesture_Volume_Control.py" and the same code is also written in "virtualkeyboard.py"(starting from the        211th line) so there is no need to download it specially for the "virtualkeyboard.py".

**If you want to run this project using Docker & Jenkins for seemless you can also do that now, you have to install Docker & Jenkins on your pc and run this project using WSL on your windows pc.**
