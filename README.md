# Hand-Gestured-Virtual-Controllers
This repository is made by Sahil Gupta and i provided my 4th semester B.Tech project as an open-source project so that any student in the future can use this repository to make this Touchless Computing Project using python.

In this repository there are 6 python files but if anyone wants to run: 
1.) virtual keyboard, then he/she should run the virtualkeboard.py 
2.) virtual mouse, then he/she should run the mouse.py 
3.) volume controller, then he/she should run the Gesture_Volume_Control.py
4.) Voice assistant, then he/she should run the advanced_voice_assistant.py

Don't Compete...Let's Collaborate...

BE HAPPY AND STAY POSITIVE...
